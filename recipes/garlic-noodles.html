    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These garlic noodles are deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious. Garlic noodles were invented back in the '70s at a restaurant in San Francisco called Thanh Long. Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab, the recipe is a very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of investigation, and even more experimentation, I think this is very close.
